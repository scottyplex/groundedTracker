## **About the Project**

The **Trinket Tracker** provides a simple, standalone solution for managing various items. It aims to offer an intuitive interface for adding, viewing, and organizing your collection. This project was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding of core web development principles and to build a functional tool from the ground up.

## **Learning & Future Plans**

This project has been instrumental in strengthening my skills in front-end development, including responsive design, DOM manipulation, and efficient client-side data persistence. I intend to revisit and expand upon this application in the future, potentially integrating new features or exploring different architectural patterns.
